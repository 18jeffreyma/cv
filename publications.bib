    abstract = {The prosperity of location-based social networking has paved the way for new applications of group-based activity planning and marketing. While such applications heavily rely on geo-social group queries (GSGQs), existing studies fail to produce a cohesive group in terms of user acquaintance. In this paper, we propose a new family of GSGQs with minimum acquaintance constraints. They are more appealing to users as they guarantee a worst-case acquaintance level in the result group. For efficient processing of GSGQs on large location-based social networks, we devise two social-aware spatial index structures, namely SaR-tree and SaR*-tree. The latter improves on the former by considering both spatial and social distances when clustering objects. Based on SaR-tree and SaR*-tree, novel algorithms are developed to process various GSGQs. Extensive experiments on real datasets Gowalla and Twitter show that our proposed methods substantially outperform the baseline algorithms under various system settings.},

Measuring eye gaze and emotion recognition in children with autism is challenging, as standard clinical assessments must be delivered in clinical settings by a trained clinician. Wearable technologies may be able to bring eye gaze and emotion recognition into natural social interactions and settings.},

%     abstract = {Blockchain has emerged as a promising solution for secure data storage and retrieval for decentralized applications. To scale blockchain systems, a prevailing approach is to employ a hybrid storage model, where only small meta-data are stored on-chain while the raw data are outsourced to an off-chain storage service provider. The key issue for query processing in such a system is the design of \emph{gas}-efficient authenticated data structure (ADS) to authenticate the query results. In this paper, we study novel ADS schemes for authenticated keyword search in hybrid-storage blockchains. We first propose the suppressed Merkle inverted (Merkle$^{inv}$) index, which maintains only a partial ADS structure on-chain that can be securely updated with a logarithm-sized cryptographic proof. Moreover, we propose a Chameleon inverted (Chameleon$^{inv}$) index that leverages the chameleon vector commitment to achieve a constant maintenance cost. It is further optimized with Bloom filters to enhance the query and verification performance. We prove the security of the proposed ADS schemes and evaluate their performance using real datasets on the Ethereum platform. Experimental results show that, compared to a baseline solution, the proposed Merkle$^{inv}$ and Chameleon$^{inv}$ indexes reduce the average on-chain maintenance cost from US\$11.21 down to US\$2.69 and US\$0.24, respectively, without sacrificing much the query performance.},
